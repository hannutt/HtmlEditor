ABOUT THE APPLICATION

A Windows Presentation Foundation-based desktop application that helps the user create html files.
When the user launches the app, the app automatically generates HTML boilerplate code in the app's TextBox element.

The application supports C# drag and drop and provides ready-made HTML tags in Button elements. These tags can be dragged and dropped into a TextBox element where the HTML page is written. Users can also create their own HTML elements by typing them into the TextField input field. After typing, the element is generated in its own button element and can be dragged and dropped into the TextBox element.
