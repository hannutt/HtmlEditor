ABOUT THE APPLICATION

A Windows Presentation Foundation-based desktop application that helps the user create HTML and CSS files.
The user can use the radio buttons to choose whether the program generates HTML or CSS boilerplate code.
The application supports C# drag and drop and provides ready-made HTML or CSS tags in Button elements. These tags
can be dragged and dropped into a TextBox element where the HTML page is written. Button elements contain either HTML or CSS t
ags depending on which the user has selected. Users can also create their own HTML elements by typing them into the TextField
input field. After typing, the element is generated in its own button element and can be dragged and dropped into the TextBox element.

SAVE AND LOAD FILE

The application uses C#'s FileDialog and File classes to save and load files.

WEBSITE PREVIEW
